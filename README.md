# Bellabeat Case Study: How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Bellabeat is a fictional manufacturer of health-focused technology products for women. Founded in 2013 and now a successful small company, Bellabeat wants to expand further into the global smart device market. The company currently offers several smart device products including a wellness tracker, a smartwatch, and smart water bottle, and an app to connect to these smart products and manage user data. Bellabeat offers a subscription-based membership for users to access fully personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, and mindfulness based on their lifestyle and goals.

<h3>Stakeholder Goals</h3>
In order to better inform Bellabeat's marketing strategy, the company's cofounder and Chief Creative Officer would like to understand how consumers use smart devices across the market and find out how that may translate to the way Bellabeat consumers use their devices. They want to understand the following:<br><br>
<b>1. What are some trends in smart device usage?<br>
  2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?<br>
  3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?</b>
  
<h2>Data</h2>
The dataset is made up of external data not provided by Bellabeat. It is a series of observations of 30 individual fitness device users from which the Bellabeat marketing team hopes to extrapolate information about its own consumers. <br><br>

To approximate this data, this case study is an analysis of a public datset of 30 individal Fitbit users' tracking behaviors as recorded by their wearable fitness technology devices. This dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit).

<h3>Limitations</h3>
30 users is the lower threshold for the sample size of a study whose results have statistical significance. Ideally, the data team would find and study a dataset with a higher number of users so that the insights derived from the data would have stronger validity.
