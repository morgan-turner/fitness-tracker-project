--SQL queries performed in BiqQuery Cloud for further analysis 
--First, I need to make a table of average steps per user:

SELECT Id, ROUND(AVG(TotalSteps),0) AS AverageSteps,
FROM `fitness-project-353417.fitbit_data.daily_activity` 
GROUP BY Id


SELECT 
  CASE WHEN AverageSteps >=0 AND AverageSteps <= 5000 THEN "Sedentary"
      WHEN AverageSteps >5000 AND AverageSteps <= 7499 THEN "Light Active"
      WHEN AverageSteps >7499 AND AverageSteps <= 9999 THEN "Moderate Active"
      WHEN AverageSteps >9999 AND AverageSteps <= 12499 THEN "Active"
      ELSE "Very Active"
  END ActivityRange,
  COUNT(*) AS TotalWithinRange
FROM
`fitness-project-353417.fitbit_data.daily_activity` ;
